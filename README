How to run?
------------

mobile.py, trapper.py and vincent.py
These three files are used to start site manger in different nodes.

Arguments
----------

MobileSiteManager provides fewer arguments than BaseDTNSiteMnager
	dtn = MobileSiteManager(dtn_port=25555, bcast_port=26666, ip=ip, db_name='mobile', sh='mobile', target='abc')

BaseDTNSiteManager extends MobileSiteManager and more arguments can be
configured. The following code shows all possible arguments.
	dtn = BaseDTNSiteManager(dtn_port=15555, bcast_port=16666, server_ip=ip, server_port=5555,
			vclient_port=4445,monitor_port=17777, ip=ip, sh='vincent', db_name='vincent')

Whenever the site manager is created, it can run by calling `dtn.start()`

In order to find neaby site mangers, call `dtn.bcast(port)` and it will print
out the ip of the first responding site manager. To connect to another site manger manually, call `dtn.connect_to_sm(ip,
port)`.

TODO
-----

Currently, some operations need to be run manually. Therefore some scripts could be added to automate these processes.
